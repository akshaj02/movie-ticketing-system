# movie-ticketing-system
Wrote a script in C that lets you book tickets in a movie theater. As soon as we run the program, it asks for a file name to save the seats that are booked. Once the files are opened, it creates a map where tou can choose the number of seats and the corresponding seat number. Once the seats are selected, it shows a map of the theater and wishes the user a good movie experience.
